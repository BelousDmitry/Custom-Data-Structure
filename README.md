# Data structure for cinema

All movies are in the `VideoDB1.txt` file. First, they are loaded as a `List` data structure. 
Then, It creates four arrays(`Set`) which contain property and pointer to the array of pointers of the movies that share the same property. 
Those arrays are also sorted to enable binary search by property(category) value.
